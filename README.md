# Hi there, I'm Su-Jeong! 👋

I’m a frontend developer with 8 years of experience, building user-focused web applications with JavaScript and modern frameworks such as React and Vue.js.
I enjoy shaping interfaces that feel clear, intuitive, and reliable in everyday use.

Over the years, I’ve worked on turning complex requirements into structured, maintainable frontend solutions.
I care about clean code, thoughtful UI decisions, and building things that age well over time.
